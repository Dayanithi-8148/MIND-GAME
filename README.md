Welcome to the Mind Game! This interactive program will read your mind and guess the number you are thinking of by asking you a series of "yes" or "no" questions. Follow the instructions carefully, and be amazed as the program reveals your number.

Instructions:

       1 . Think of any number between 1 and 30.

       2 . The program will ask you five questions. For each question, simply answer "yes" or "no".

       3 . Based on your answers, the program will reveal the number you were thinking of.

Code Description: 

      Introduction: 
            The program starts by welcoming the user and providing instructions to think of a number between 1 and 30. It prompts the user to enter "start" to begin.
      Data Preparation: 
            Five lists (A, B, C, D, E) contain numbers from 1 to 31 in a specific pattern. These patterns help the program determine the user's number based on their answers.
      Questions and Input: 
            The program displays each list in turn and asks the user if their number is present in the list. The user must answer "yes" or "no" for each list.
      Calculation: 
            For each "yes" answer, the program adds a specific value (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16) to a sum. These values correspond to the binary representation of the numbers in the lists.
      Result: 
            After collecting all answers, the program calculates the sum and reveals the number the user was thinking of.

Conclusion:

      This Mind Game is a fun and interactive way to demonstrate basic principles of binary numbers and user interaction in Python. Give it a try and be amazed by the accuracy of the program!
